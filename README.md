# appWorker
Fun little Webworker control and manipulation class to encapsulate and keep track of your available and running webworkers, 

Install:
Just put all three files in the same folder and open the index.html file in a webworker enabled browser, like Chrome.

Features:
The main feature here is the app.js file and the appWorker() function designed to maintain a store and loading mechanism for a applications group of webworkers. 

Usage:
To use the demo "counter.js" script, just click [Run Script] and watch the counter count +1 every second.

Have fun!
Add more scripts, using the appWorker() function. Make improvements and pull requests until this looks like a powerful standalone piece of software for all of us to use!
